# Health-Insurance-Premium-Price-Prediction
This project predicts health insurance premiums based on personal attributes such as age, gender, BMI, family size, and smoking habits. Using a dataset that captures the relationship between these features and medical insurance charges, the model provides insights into how these factors influence healthcare costs.

Features:
Data Analysis: Explored and visualized relationships between attributes and insurance charges.
Feature Engineering: Cleaned and processed data for optimal model performance.
Machine Learning: Built and trained regression models to predict insurance premiums.
Interpretability: Analyzed the importance of each attribute in determining costs.
Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Highlights:
Demonstrates the impact of key factors like smoking habits and BMI on premium costs.
Offers a practical tool for insurers to estimate premiums and for users to understand cost determinants.
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the notebook or script to train and test the model on the dataset.
This project showcases the application of machine learning in the insurance domain, providing actionable insights and accurate predictions.
